function myPVal = weightedKS2D(sample1, sample2, quadrantCounts1cross, quadrantCounts1self, quadrantCounts2cross, quadrantCounts2self, W1, W2, selectN1, selectN2)
% This function performs a two-sided 2D KS test and returns a p-value.
% It is assumed quadrant counts are performed prior to running this test.
% Note these tests currently can require a substantial computational
% overhead and a shortcut is included to speed the calculation by ignoring
% data with low weight.

% The original code also did not appear to take into consideration
% the comparison for all the pooled (N1+N2) x (N1+N2) points
% as proposed by Peacock. The original code
% was closer to the method by Fasano & Franceschini.  This code has
% ben updated to better correspond to the F&F method
% by also using the weighted correlations for the calculation
% of the test statistic in addition to the 
% observed points.
